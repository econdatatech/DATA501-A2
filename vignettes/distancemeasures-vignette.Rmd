As a user of the distancemeasures package you will provide the program with a data set (dataframe) as well as a model (which is an object of class lm) and an optional boolean to decide if you want plots to be rendered (default mode) or not.
Three measures of influence will be calculated, printed and plotted (unless suppressed by input parameter plot=FALSE"):

* Cooks Distance Measure (Cook, 1977) 
* DFFITS (Welsch and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980) 
* Hadis Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992) 

As an example we generate some random data, fit a linear model and then plot some distance/influence measures

The package has one single exposed / exported function, namely distances(data,model,plots=TRUE)

```{r packageuse, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(distancemeasures)
# Generate the independent variable and the error
x1 <- rnorm(100, 50, 9)
x2 <- rnorm(100, 200, 64)
error <- rnorm(100, 0, 16)
# Generate the dependent variable 
y1 <- 150 - (4 * x1) + (2.5 * x2) + error

#build dataframe with complete input data
randomdata <- data.frame(y1, x1, x2)
# Fit a linear regression model
# Predicting y1 based on x1 and x2
model <- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2, data = randomdata)
#set margins to allow plotting in the vignette
par(mar = rep(2, 4))
#Execute the function
distances(randomdata, model)
```
