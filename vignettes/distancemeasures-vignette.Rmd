As a user of the distancemeasures package you will provide the program with a data set as well as a model (which is an object of class lm).
Three measures of influence will then be calculated and plotted (unless supressed by input parameter plot=FALSE").

* Cooks Distance Measure (Cook, 1977) 
* DFFITS (Welsch and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980) 
* Hadis Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992) 

As an example we can use the data from the famous car package and fit a linear model and then plot some distance/influence measures

The package has one single user facing function, namely distances()

```{r packageuse, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(distancemeasures)
#Generate the independent variable and the error
x1=rnorm(100,50,9)
x2=rnorm(100,200,64)
error=rnorm(100,0,16)
#Generate the dependent variable (b0=150, b1=-4, b2=2.5)
y1=150-(4*x1)+(2.5*x2)+error

randomdata<- data.frame(y1, x1, x2)
# Fit a linear regression model
# Predicting y1 based on x1 and x2 
model <- lm(y1 ~ x1 + x2, data = randomdata)
par(mar = rep(2, 4))
distances(randomdata,model)
```
