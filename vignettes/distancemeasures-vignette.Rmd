As a user of the distancemeasures package you will provide the program with a data set as well as a model (which is an object of class lm).
Three measures of influence will then be calculated and plotted (unless supressed by input parameter plot=FALSE").

* Cooks Distance Measure (Cook, 1977) 
* DFFITS (Welsch and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980) 
* Hadis Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992) 

As an example we can use the data from the famous car package and fit a linear model and then plot some distance/influence measures

```{r packageuse, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(car)
library(distancemeasures)
data(mtcars)
# Fit a linear regression model
# Predicting 'mpg' (miles per gallon) based on 
# 'disp' (displacement), 'hp' (horsepower), and 'wt' (weight)
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
par(mar = rep(2, 4))
distances(mtcars,model)
```
