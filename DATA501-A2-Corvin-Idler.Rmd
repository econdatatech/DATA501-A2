This is a PDF generated from a RMarkdown file for Assignment 2 of the DATA 501 class 2024 from Victoria University Wellington
https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/data/501/2024/offering?crn=33170

The repository underpinning this file and assignement can be found at https://github.com/econdatatech/distancemeasures/
I created an R package hosted at the above URL that will be loaded with the following lines of code

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(devtools)
install_github("econdatatech/distancemeasures")
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
data(mtcars)

# Fit a linear regression model
# Predicting 'mpg' (miles per gallon) based on 'disp' (displacement), 'hp' (horsepower), and 'wt' (weight)
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)

```


The user will provide the program with a data set as well as a model (which is an object of class lm)
The functionality of the program entail performing a simple diagnostics on the influence of points.

The code should be able to calculate at least three measures of influence:

* Cooks Distance Measure (Cook, 1977) 
* DFFITS (Welsch and Kuh, 1977; Belsley, 1980) 
* Hadis Influence Measure (Hadi, 1992) 



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
